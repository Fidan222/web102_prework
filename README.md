# WEB102 Prework - Sea Monster Crowdfunding

Submitted by: Fidan Tahirli


Sea Monster App is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 7 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [ ] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [ ] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [ ] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
Even though we have the list games, i think it would be nice when we click on the 1st winner and 2nd winner, the page takes us to another page with those games info.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Reduce function was new to me, so I had some challenges understading how it works and implementing it to my app.
As well as the filter function took some time to implement it for the app.
